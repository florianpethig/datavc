*,note,note_intro,"My name is Florian Pethig and I am a researcher at the Chair of Enterprise Systems at University of Mannheim. As part of the [Open Science Fellows Program](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Deutschland/Open_Science_Fellows_Program) funded by [Wikimedia Deutschland](https://www.wikimedia.de), I am doing a survey about how researchers process and analyze their empirical research data. Answering the survey will take between 5 and 10 minutes.

Your responses will serve as important input for [my project](https://de.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Fellow-Programm_Freies_Wissen/Einreichungen/Data_Version_Control:_Best_Practice_for_Reproducible,_Shareable_Science%3F) that identifies suitable tools to facilitate version control of research data. In the spirit of open science, I plan to publish the responses to this survey, but they will be kept anonymous.

Your participation in this research is voluntary. You have the right to withdraw from the survey at any point and for any reason without penalty. By clicking the forward button, you acknowledge that you have read the information above and are consenting to participate. You are free to skip any question that you choose.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me at [pethig@uni-mannheim.de](mailto:pethig@uni-mannheim.de).
